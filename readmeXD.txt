xili-dictionary is a dictionary storable to create and translate .po files or .mo files and more... 

== Description ==

xili-dictionary is a plugin (compatible with xili-language) to build a multilingual dictionary saved in the taxonomy tables of WordPress. With this dictionary, collecting terms from categories (title, description), from current theme (international terms with _e() or __() functions), it is possible to create and update .mo file in the current theme folder.

THIS VERSION 0.9.6 IS A BETA VERSION (running on our sites and elsewhere) - WE NEED MORE FEEDBACK even if the first from world are good - coded as OOP and new admin UI WP 2.7 features (meta_box, js, screen options,...)

Some features (importing themes words) are not totally stable (if coding is crazy - too spacing !)...

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder containing `xili-language.php` and language files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory,
2. Verify that your theme is international compatible - translatable terms like _e('the term','mytheme') and no text hardcoded - 
3. more details soon...
