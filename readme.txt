xili-dictionary is a dictionary storable in CPT and terms to create and translate .po files or .mo files and more...

== Description ==

**xili-dictionary is a dictionary storable in custom post type (CPT) and terms (custom taxonomy) to create, update and translate .po files or .mo files of current theme folder and of current plugins.**

* xili-dictionary is a plugin (compatible with xili-language) to build a multilingual dictionary saved in the post tables of WordPress as CPT.
* With this dictionary, collecting terms from taxonomies (title, description), from bloginfos, from wp_locale, from current theme - international terms with ` _e(), __() or _n() or _x(),  _ex(), _nx(),... ` and other functions as in I10n.php - , it is possible to create and update .mo file in the current theme folder and current plugins.
* By importing .mo files, it is possible to regenerate readable .po files and enrich translation tables.
* xili-dictionary is full compatible with [xili-language](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/) plugin and [xili-tidy-tags](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-tidy-tags/) plugin.

= Version 2.6.1 (updated 2014-03-08) =
see [Changelog tab](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-dictionary/changelog/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder containing `xili-dictionary.php` and language files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory,
2. Verify that your theme is international compatible - translatable terms like `_e('the term','mytheme')` and no text hardcoded -
3. Activate and visit the dictionary page in tools menu and docs [here](http://dev.xiligroup.com/xili-dictionary/) -
4. To edit a msg, you can start from dictionary list or XD msg list using current WP admin UI library. Don't forget to adapt UI with screen options and moving meta boxes.

More infos will be added progressively in a wiki [here](http://wiki.xiligroup.org/index.php/Main_Page).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why xili-dictionary is not included in xili-language ? =

* because xili-dictionary is available for non multilingual site to manage theme and plugin translations.
* because it is possible to desactivate xili-dictionary after creation of po mo files used by WP and xili-language.

= What about WP multisite (or network - former named WPMU) and the trilogy ? =
[xili-language](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/), [xili-tidy-tags](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-tidy-tags/), [xili-dictionary](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-dictionary/)

Since WP 3.0-alpha, if multisite is activated, the trilogy is compatible and will include progressively some improvements dedicaded especially for WP network context. Future specific docs will be available for registered webmasters to describe where mo files where saved.

= Where can I see websites using this plugin ? =
dev.xiligroup.com [here](http://dev.xiligroup.com/?p=187 "why xili-language ?") and example child themes below:

Twenty Ten [2010](http://multilingual.wpmu.xilione.com/)

Twenty Eleven [2011](http://2011.wpmu.xilione.com/)

Twenty Twelve [2012](http://2012.wpmu.xilione.com/)

Responsive [responsive](http://childxili.wpmu.xilione.com/)

Twenty Thirteen [2013](http://2013.extend.xiligroup.org/)

Twenty Fourteen [2014](http://2014.extend.xiligroup.org/)

And as you can see in [stats](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xili-language/stats/), thousand of sites use xili-language.

= What is the difference with msgid and msgtr in .po file ? =
The msgid line is equal to the term or sentence hardcoded in the theme functions like  ` _e() or __() `. msgstr is the translation in the target language : by instance `fr_FR.po` for a french dictionary. (the compiled file is `fr_FR.mo` saved in the theme folder.
The root language is in Wordpress currently `en_US`, but with xili-dictionary, it is possible to create a `en_US.mo` containing the only few terms that you want to adapt or modify.

= Is xili-dictionary usable without xili-language to edit .po or .mo file ? =

Yes and now automatically detected ! For example, to modify the results of a translation for your site with your words.

= What about plural translations ? =
Today works with .mo or .po with simple twin msgid msgstr couple of lines and themes with functions like  ` _e() or __() ` for localization AND `_n()` which manage singular and plural terms like `msgid, msgid_plural, msgstr[0],...`

= What is a po file ? =

It is a text file like this (here excerpt) with different types of msgid :

`
msgctxt "comments number"
msgid "%"
msgstr "%"

msgid "Leave a reply"
msgstr "Laisser une réponse"

msgid "One thought on &ldquo;%2$s&rdquo;"
msgid_plural "%1$s thoughts on &ldquo;%2$s&rdquo;"
msgstr[0] "Une réflexion au sujet de &laquo&nbsp;%2$s&nbsp;&raquo;"
msgstr[1] "%1$s réflexions au sujet de &laquo&nbsp;%2$s&nbsp;&raquo;"

msgctxt "sentence"
msgid "comment"
msgid_plural "comments"
msgstr[0] "commentaire"
msgstr[1] "commentaires"

`

= What happens if only the .mo is available ? =

xili-dictionary is able to import a .mo of the target language and rebuild a .po editable in backend or a text editor. Example: if it_IT is in your language list, it_IT.mo can be imported, completed by webmaster and export as it_IT.po text file in languages sub-folder of the theme (as text backup).



== Screenshots ==

1. The admin settings UI: table for sub-selection and create or import files (.mo or .po).
2. Msg edit screen with the msg series dashboard.
3. Msg list table screen as designed with WP admin UI library.
4. MsgID with his singular and his plural line.
5. MsgSTR with his plural.

== Upgrade Notice ==

Upgrading can be easily procedeed through WP admin UI or through ftp (delete previous release folder before upgrading via ftp).
IMPORTANT - Don't forget to backup before.
Verify you install latest version of trilogy (xili-language, xili-tidy-tags,…).

== More infos ==

This releases are for theme's creator or designer with some knowledges in i18n. Help are more and more included inside help tabs of dashboard and each screen.
